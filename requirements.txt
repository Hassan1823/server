## SkillShareSpace: Skill Barter Platform

### Overview:

In today's fast-paced world, everyone has a unique skill set. "SkillShareSpace" is a MERN stack single-page application that acts as a nexus for individuals looking to exchange skills without the transaction of money. This platform taps into the barter system's power, offering a space where learning and teaching coexist.

### User Story:

1. As a user, I want to register and create a profile highlighting my skills.
2. As a registered user, I want to list the skills I can offer and the skills I'm seeking.
3. As a user, I want to browse through available skills and view user profiles offering those skills.
4. As a user, I want to send a skill exchange request and discuss the terms of the exchange (e.g., Iâ€™ll teach you Spanish for 10 sessions if you help me build a website).
5. As a registered user, I want to receive notifications of skill exchange requests and accept or decline them.
6. As a user, I want to leave feedback or rate other users based on our exchange experience.
7. As a user, I want a responsive platform that's easy to navigate, search, and filter by skill categories.
